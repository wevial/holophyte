"""Factory loop control flow, driven end to end with zero agent calls.

The paths under test are the ones that used to need live agents to exercise:
a clean approval that merges, both review rounds spending their findings and
their fix rounds before a terminal PASS, the two ways adjudication refuses to
merge, and the failure-pattern escalation that stops a ticket the loop keeps
failing on from being claimed again. `tests/fake_agent.py` scripts the agent
turns; everything else is real — a real throwaway repo, real worktrees, the
real verify gate, the real `--no-ff` merge — so what these tests assert is the
loop's behavior and not a model of it.
