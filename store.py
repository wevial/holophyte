"""store: the v2 durable state store, one WAL-mode SQLite file.

Local-first by resolved decision (2026-08-22): all loop state lives behind
this one module so a hosted backend later is a driver swap, not a loop
rewrite. Stdlib ``sqlite3`` only.

This ticket bootstraps the schema and nothing else — ``open()`` and
``init()`` are the whole API. Query helpers (claim lease, idempotency,
pickability, status transitions, resume, fingerprints) belong to the later
tickets in this chain.

Conventions, fixed here for every later ticket to follow:

* **camelCase** table and column names, matching the field names in the
  state model verbatim. The table names are camelCase in the contract
  (``reviewRounds``, ``runEvents``, ``linearDeliveries``), so the columns
  follow rather than splitting the file across two casings.
* **List-typed fields are JSON text.** SQLite has no array type, so the
  contract's ``string[]`` and object-array fields are stored as a JSON
  document defaulting to ``'[]'``. Encoding/decoding is a later ticket's
  concern; the schema only pins the storage.
* **Optional (``?``) fields are nullable; everything else is NOT NULL.**
* **Union types become CHECK constraints**, so an unknown status, phase or
  verdict is rejected by the database rather than by a caller who
  remembered to look.
* **Rows are keyed by a synthetic ``id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY``**, standing in
  for the contract's Convex-shaped ``Id<table>`` references.

Contract source: docs/v2/state-model.md §1-§2, plus the per-project lease
column from §7. That document is deliberately gitignored, so the sections
are cited here instead of vendored.

# One statement per table, in dependency order where it matters. Every
# statement is IF NOT EXISTS, which is the whole of init()'s idempotency:
# re-running it on a populated database is a no-op, not a rebuild.
#
# `trigger` and `action` are SQLite keywords, so those two column names are
# quoted; they are the contract's names and renaming them to dodge the
# quoting would break the mirror.
